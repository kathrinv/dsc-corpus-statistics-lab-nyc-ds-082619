All haile Macbeth, that shalt be King hereafter\\n\\n   Banq. Good Sir, why doe you start, and seeme to feare\\nThings that doe sound so faire? i'th' name of truth\\nAre ye fantasticall, or that indeed\\nWhich outwardly ye shew? My Noble Partner\\nYou greet with present Grace, and great prediction\\nOf Noble hauing, and of Royall hope,\\nThat he seemes wrapt withall: to me you speake not.\\nIf you can looke into the Seedes of Time,\\nAnd say, which Graine will grow, and which will not,\\nSpeake then to me, who neyther begge, nor feare\\nYour fauors, nor your hate\\n\\n   1.

Thou shalt get Kings, though thou be none:\\nSo all haile Macbeth, and Banquo\\n\\n   1. Banquo, and Macbeth, all haile\\n\\n   Macb. Stay you imperfect Speakers, tell me more:\\nBy Sinells death, I know I am Thane of Glamis,\\nBut how, of Cawdor? the Thane of Cawdor liues\\nA prosperous Gentleman: And to be King,\\nStands not within the prospect of beleefe,\\nNo more then to be Cawdor. Say from whence\\nYou owe this strange Intelligence, or why\\nVpon this blasted Heath you stop our way\\nWith such Prophetique greeting?\\nSpeake, I charge you.\\n\\nWitches vanish.\\n\\n  Banq. The Earth hath bubbles, as the Water ha's,\\nAnd these are of them: whither are they vanish'd?\\n  Macb. Into the Ayre: and what seem'd corporall,\\nMelted, as breath into the Winde.\\nWould they had stay'd\\n\\n   Banq. Were such things here, as we doe speake about?\\nOr haue we eaten on the insane Root,\\nThat takes the Reason Prisoner?\\n  Macb. Your Children shall be Kings\\n\\n   Banq. You shall be King\\n\\n   Macb. And Thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?\\n  Banq. Toth' selfe-same tune and words: who's here?\\nEnter Rosse and Angus.\\n\\n  Rosse.

Wee are sent,\\nTo giue thee from our Royall Master thanks,\\nOnely to harrold thee into his sight,\\nNot pay thee\\n\\n   Rosse. And for an earnest of a greater Honor,\\nHe bad me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor:\\nIn which addition, haile most worthy Thane,\\nFor it is thine\\n\\n   Banq. What, can the Deuill speake true?\\n  Macb. The Thane of Cawdor liues:\\nWhy doe you dresse me in borrowed Robes?\\n  Ang. Who was the Thane, liues yet,\\nBut vnder heauie Iudgement beares that Life,\\nWhich he deserues to loose.\\nWhether he was combin'd with those of Norway,\\nOr did lyne the Rebell with hidden helpe,\\nAnd vantage; or that with both he labour'd\\nIn his Countreyes wracke, I know not:\\nBut Treasons Capitall, confess'd, and prou'd,\\nHaue ouerthrowne him\\n\\n   Macb. Glamys, and Thane of Cawdor:\\nThe greatest is behinde. Thankes for your paines.\\nDoe you not hope your Children shall be Kings,\\nWhen those that gaue the Thane of Cawdor to me,\\nPromis'd no lesse to them\\n\\n   Banq. That trusted home,\\nMight yet enkindle you vnto the Crowne,\\nBesides the Thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:\\nAnd oftentimes, to winne vs to our harme,\\nThe Instruments of Darknesse tell vs Truths,\\nWinne vs with honest Trifles, to betray's\\nIn deepest consequence.\\nCousins, a word, I pray you\\n\\n   Macb. Two Truths are told,\\nAs happy Prologues to the swelling Act\\nOf the Imperiall Theame. I thanke you Gentlemen:\\nThis supernaturall solliciting\\nCannot be ill; cannot be good.\\nIf ill? why hath it giuen me earnest of successe,\\nCommencing in a Truth? I am Thane of Cawdor.\\nIf good? why doe I yeeld to that suggestion,\\nWhose horrid Image doth vnfixe my Heire,\\nAnd make my seated Heart knock at my Ribbes,\\nAgainst the vse of Nature? Present Feares\\nAre lesse then horrible Imaginings:\\nMy Thought, whose Murther yet is but fantasticall,\\nShakes so my single state of Man,\\nThat Function is smother'd in surmise,\\nAnd nothing is, but what is not\\n\\n   Banq. Looke how our Partner's rapt\\n\\n   Macb. If Chance will haue me King,\\nWhy Chance may Crowne me,\\nWithout my stirre\\n\\n   Banq. New Honors come vpon him\\nLike our strange Garments, cleaue not to their mould,\\nBut with the aid of vse\\n\\n   Macb. Come what come may,\\nTime, and the Houre, runs through the roughest Day\\n\\n   Banq. Worthy Macbeth, wee stay vpon your leysure\\n\\n   Macb. Giue me your fauour:\\nMy dull Braine was wrought with things forgotten.\\nKinde Gentlemen, your paines are registred,\\nWhere euery day I turne the Leafe,\\nTo reade them.\\nLet vs toward the King: thinke vpon\\nWhat hath chanc'd: and at more time,\\nThe Interim hauing weigh'd it, let vs speake\\nOur free Hearts each to other\\n\\n   Banq.

Is execution done on Cawdor?\\nOr not those in Commission yet return'd?\\n  Mal. My Liege, they are not yet come back.\\nBut I haue spoke with one that saw him die:\\nWho did report, that very frankly hee\\nConfess'd his Treasons, implor'd your Highnesse Pardon,\\nAnd set forth a deepe Repentance:\\nNothing in his Life became him,\\nLike the leauing it. Hee dy'de,\\nAs one that had beene studied in his death,\\nTo throw away the dearest thing he ow'd,\\nAs 'twere a carelesse Trifle\\n\\n   King.

All our seruice,\\nIn euery point twice done, and then done double,\\nWere poore, and single Businesse, to contend\\nAgainst those Honors deepe, and broad,\\nWherewith your Maiestie loades our House:\\nFor those of old, and the late Dignities,\\nHeap'd vp to them, we rest your Ermites\\n\\n   King. Where's the Thane of Cawdor?\\nWe courst him at the heeles, and had a purpose\\nTo be his Purueyor: But he rides well,\\nAnd his great Loue (sharpe as his Spurre) hath holp him\\nTo his home before vs: Faire and Noble Hostesse\\nWe are your guest to night\\n\\n   La. Your Seruants euer,\\nHaue theirs, themselues, and what is theirs in compt,\\nTo make their Audit at your Highnesse pleasure,\\nStill to returne your owne\\n\\n   King.

Enter a Sewer, and diuers Seruants with Dishes\\nand\\nSeruice ouer the Stage. Then enter Macbeth\\n\\n   Macb. If it were done, when 'tis done, then 'twer well,\\nIt were done quickly: If th' Assassination\\nCould trammell vp the Consequence, and catch\\nWith his surcease, Successe: that but this blow\\nMight be the be all, and the end all. Heere,\\nBut heere, vpon this Banke and Schoole of time,\\nWee'ld iumpe the life to come. But in these Cases,\\nWe still haue iudgement heere, that we but teach\\nBloody Instructions, which being taught, returne\\nTo plague th' Inuenter, this euen-handed Iustice\\nCommends th' Ingredience of our poyson'd Challice\\nTo our owne lips. Hee's heere in double trust;\\nFirst, as I am his Kinsman, and his Subiect,\\nStrong both against the Deed: Then, as his Host,\\nWho should against his Murtherer shut the doore,\\nNot beare the knife my selfe. Besides, this Duncane\\nHath borne his Faculties so meeke; hath bin\\nSo cleere in his great Office, that his Vertues\\nWill pleade like Angels, Trumpet-tongu'd against\\nThe deepe damnation of his taking off:\\nAnd Pitty, like a naked New-borne-Babe,\\nStriding the blast, or Heauens Cherubin, hors'd\\nVpon the sightlesse Curriors of the Ayre,\\nShall blow the horrid deed in euery eye,\\nThat teares shall drowne the winde. I haue no Spurre\\nTo pricke the sides of my intent, but onely\\nVaulting Ambition, which ore-leapes it selfe,\\nAnd falles on th' other.\\nEnter Lady.\\n\\nHow now? What Newes?\\n  La.

We will proceed no further in this Businesse:\\nHe hath Honour'd me of late, and I haue bought\\nGolden Opinions from all sorts of people,\\nWhich would be worne now in their newest glosse,\\nNot cast aside so soone\\n\\n   La. Was the hope drunke,\\nWherein you drest your selfe? Hath it slept since?\\nAnd wakes it now to looke so greene, and pale,\\nAt what it did so freely? From this time,\\nSuch I account thy loue. Art thou affear'd\\nTo be the same in thine owne Act, and Valour,\\nAs thou art in desire? Would'st thou haue that\\nWhich thou esteem'st the Ornament of Life,\\nAnd liue a Coward in thine owne Esteeme?\\nLetting I dare not, wait vpon I would,\\nLike the poore Cat i'th' Addage\\n\\n   Macb. Prythee peace:\\nI dare do all that may become a man,\\nWho dares do more, is none\\n\\n   La. What Beast was't then\\nThat made you breake this enterprize to me?\\nWhen you durst do it, then you were a man:\\nAnd to be more then what you were, you would\\nBe so much more the man. Nor time, nor place\\nDid then adhere, and yet you would make both:\\nThey haue made themselues, and that their fitnesse now\\nDo's vnmake you. I haue giuen Sucke, and know\\nHow tender 'tis to loue the Babe that milkes me,\\nI would, while it was smyling in my Face,\\nHaue pluckt my Nipple from his Bonelesse Gummes,\\nAnd dasht the Braines out, had I so sworne\\nAs you haue done to this\\n\\n   Macb. If we should faile?\\n  Lady. We faile?\\nBut screw your courage to the sticking place,\\nAnd wee'le not fayle: when Duncan is asleepe,\\n(Whereto the rather shall his dayes hard Iourney\\nSoundly inuite him) his two Chamberlaines\\nWill I with Wine, and Wassell, so conuince,\\nThat Memorie, the Warder of the Braine,\\nShall be a Fume, and the Receit of Reason\\nA Lymbeck onely: when in Swinish sleepe,\\nTheir drenched Natures lyes as in a Death,\\nWhat cannot you and I performe vpon\\nTh' vnguarded Duncan? What not put vpon\\nHis spungie Officers? who shall beare the guilt\\nOf our great quell\\n\\n   Macb. Bring forth Men-Children onely:\\nFor thy vndaunted Mettle should compose\\nNothing but Males. Will it not be receiu'd,\\nWhen we haue mark'd with blood those sleepie two\\nOf his owne Chamber, and vs'd their very Daggers,\\nThat they haue don't?\\n  Lady. Who dares receiue it other,\\nAs we shall make our Griefes and Clamor rore,\\nVpon his Death?\\n  Macb. I am settled, and bend vp\\nEach corporall Agent to this terrible Feat.\\nAway, and mock the time with fairest show,\\nFalse Face must hide what the false Heart doth know.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\n\\nActus Secundus.

What Sir, not yet at rest? the King's a bed.\\nHe hath beene in vnusuall Pleasure,\\nAnd sent forth great Largesse to your Offices.\\nThis Diamond he greetes your Wife withall,\\nBy the name of most kind Hostesse,\\nAnd shut vp in measurelesse content\\n\\n   Mac. Being vnprepar'd,\\nOur will became the seruant to defect,\\nWhich else should free haue wrought\\n\\n   Banq. All's well.\\nI dreamt last Night of the three weyward Sisters:\\nTo you they haue shew'd some truth\\n\\n   Macb. I thinke not of them:\\nYet when we can entreat an houre to serue,\\nWe would spend it in some words vpon that Businesse,\\nIf you would graunt the time\\n\\n   Banq.

There's no such thing:\\nIt is the bloody Businesse, which informes\\nThus to mine Eyes. Now o're the one halfe World\\nNature seemes dead, and wicked Dreames abuse\\nThe Curtain'd sleepe: Witchcraft celebrates\\nPale Heccats Offrings: and wither'd Murther,\\nAlarum'd by his Centinell, the Wolfe,\\nWhose howle's his Watch, thus with his stealthy pace,\\nWith Tarquins rauishing sides, towards his designe\\nMoues like a Ghost. Thou sowre and firme-set Earth\\nHeare not my steps, which they may walke, for feare\\nThy very stones prate of my where-about,\\nAnd take the present horror from the time,\\nWhich now sutes with it. Whiles I threat, he liues:\\nWords to the heat of deedes too cold breath giues.\\n\\nA Bell rings.\\n\\nI goe, and it is done: the Bell inuites me.\\nHeare it not, Duncan, for it is a Knell,\\nThat summons thee to Heauen, or to Hell.\\nEnter.\\n\\n\\nScena Secunda.\\n\\nEnter Lady.\\n\\n  La.

Alack, I am afraid they haue awak'd,\\nAnd 'tis not done: th' attempt, and not the deed,\\nConfounds vs: hearke: I lay'd their Daggers ready,\\nHe could not misse 'em. Had he not resembled\\nMy Father as he slept, I had don't.\\nMy Husband?\\n  Macb. I haue done the deed:\\nDidst thou not heare a noyse?\\n  Lady.

Hearke, who lyes i'th' second Chamber?\\n  Lady. Donalbaine\\n\\n   Mac. This is a sorry sight\\n\\n   Lady. A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight\\n\\n   Macb. There's one did laugh in's sleepe,\\nAnd one cry'd Murther, that they did wake each other:\\nI stood, and heard them: But they did say their Prayers,\\nAnd addrest them againe to sleepe\\n\\n   Lady. There are two lodg'd together\\n\\n   Macb. One cry'd God blesse vs, and Amen the other,\\nAs they had seene me with these Hangmans hands:\\nListning their feare, I could not say Amen,\\nWhen they did say God blesse vs\\n\\n   Lady. Consider it not so deepely\\n\\n   Mac. But wherefore could not I pronounce Amen?\\nI had most need of Blessing, and Amen stuck in my throat\\n\\n   Lady. These deeds must not be thought\\nAfter these wayes: so, it will make vs mad\\n\\n   Macb. Me thought I heard a voyce cry, Sleep no more:\\nMacbeth does murther Sleepe, the innocent Sleepe,\\nSleepe that knits vp the rauel'd Sleeue of Care,\\nThe death of each dayes Life, sore Labors Bath,\\nBalme of hurt Mindes, great Natures second Course,\\nChiefe nourisher in Life's Feast\\n\\n   Lady. What doe you meane?\\n  Macb. Still it cry'd, Sleepe no more to all the House:\\nGlamis hath murther'd Sleepe, and therefore Cawdor\\nShall sleepe no more: Macbeth shall sleepe no more\\n\\n   Lady. Who was it, that thus cry'd? why worthy Thane,\\nYou doe vnbend your Noble strength, to thinke\\nSo braine-sickly of things: Goe get some Water,\\nAnd wash this filthie Witnesse from your Hand.\\nWhy did you bring these Daggers from the place?\\nThey must lye there: goe carry them, and smeare\\nThe sleepie Groomes with blood\\n\\n   Macb. Ile goe no more:\\nI am afraid, to thinke what I haue done:\\nLooke on't againe, I dare not\\n\\n   Lady. Infirme of purpose:\\nGiue me the Daggers: the sleeping, and the dead,\\nAre but as Pictures: 'tis the Eye of Childhood,\\nThat feares a painted Deuill.

Here's a Farmer, that hang'd\\nhimselfe on th' expectation of Plentie: Come in time, haue\\nNapkins enow about you, here you'le sweat for't.\\n\\nKnock.\\n\\nKnock, knock.

Marry, Sir, Nose-painting, Sleepe, and Vrine.\\nLecherie, Sir, it prouokes, and vnprouokes: it prouokes\\nthe desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore\\nmuch Drinke may be said to be an Equiuocator with Lecherie:\\nit makes him, and it marres him; it sets him on,\\nand it takes him off; it perswades him, and dis-heartens\\nhim; makes him stand too, and not stand too: in conclusion,\\nequiuocates him in a sleepe, and giuing him the Lye,\\nleaues him\\n\\n   Macd. I beleeue, Drinke gaue thee the Lye last Night\\n\\n   Port.

Thou art too like the Spirit of Banquo: Down:\\nThy Crowne do's seare mine Eye-bals. And thy haire\\nThou other Gold-bound-brow, is like the first:\\nA third, is like the former. Filthy Hagges,\\nWhy do you shew me this? - A fourth? Start eyes!\\nWhat will the Line stretch out to'th' cracke of Doome?\\nAnother yet? A seauenth? Ile see no more:\\nAnd yet the eighth appeares, who beares a glasse,\\nWhich shewes me many more: and some I see,\\nThat two-fold Balles, and trebble Scepters carry.\\nHorrible sight: Now I see 'tis true,\\nFor the Blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles vpon me,\\nAnd points at them for his. What? is this so?\\n  1 I Sir, all this is so. But why\\nStands Macbeth thus amazedly?\\nCome Sisters, cheere we vp his sprights,\\nAnd shew the best of our delights.\\nIle Charme the Ayre to giue a sound,\\nWhile you performe your Antique round:\\nThat this great King may kindly say,\\nOur duties, did his welcome pay.\\n\\nMusicke.

From this moment,\\nThe very firstlings of my heart shall be\\nThe firstlings of my hand. And euen now\\nTo Crown my thoughts with Acts: be it thoght & done:\\nThe Castle of Macduff, I will surprize.\\nSeize vpon Fife; giue to th' edge o'th' Sword\\nHis Wife, his Babes, and all vnfortunate Soules\\nThat trace him in his Line.

What had he done, to make him fly the Land?\\n  Rosse. You must haue patience Madam\\n\\n   Wife. He had none:\\nHis flight was madnesse: when our Actions do not,\\nOur feares do make vs Traitors\\n\\n   Rosse. You know not\\nWhether it was his wisedome, or his feare\\n\\n   Wife. Wisedom? to leaue his wife, to leaue his Babes,\\nHis Mansion, and his Titles, in a place\\nFrom whence himselfe do's flye? He loues vs not,\\nHe wants the naturall touch. For the poore Wren\\n(The most diminitiue of Birds) will fight,\\nHer yong ones in her Nest, against the Owle:\\nAll is the Feare, and nothing is the Loue;\\nAs little is the Wisedome, where the flight\\nSo runnes against all reason\\n\\n   Rosse. My deerest Cooz,\\nI pray you schoole your selfe. But for your Husband,\\nHe is Noble, Wise, Iudicious, and best knowes\\nThe fits o'th' Season. I dare not speake much further,\\nBut cruell are the times, when we are Traitors\\nAnd do not know our selues: when we hold Rumor\\nFrom what we feare, yet know not what we feare,\\nBut floate vpon a wilde and violent Sea\\nEach way, and moue. I take my leaue of you:\\nShall not be long but Ile be heere againe:\\nThings at the worst will cease, or else climbe vpward,\\nTo what they were before.

Nay how will you do for a Husband?\\n  Wife. Why I can buy me twenty at any Market\\n\\n   Son. Then you'l by 'em to sell againe\\n\\n   Wife. Thou speak'st withall thy wit,\\nAnd yet I'faith with wit enough for thee\\n\\n   Son. Was my Father a Traitor, Mother?\\n  Wife. I, that he was\\n\\n   Son. What is a Traitor?\\n  Wife. Why one that sweares, and lyes\\n\\n   Son. And be all Traitors, that do so\\n\\n   Wife. Euery one that do's so, is a Traitor,\\nAnd must be hang'd\\n\\n   Son. And must they all be hang'd, that swear and lye?\\n  Wife. Euery one\\n\\n   Son. Who must hang them?\\n  Wife. Why, the honest men\\n\\n   Son. Then the Liars and Swearers are Fools: for there\\nare Lyars and Swearers enow, to beate the honest men,\\nand hang vp them\\n\\n   Wife. Now God helpe thee, poore Monkie:\\nBut how wilt thou do for a Father?\\n  Son. If he were dead, youl'd weepe for him: if you\\nwould not, it were a good signe, that I should quickely\\nhaue a new Father\\n\\n   Wife. Poore pratler, how thou talk'st?\\nEnter a Messenger.\\n\\n  Mes. Blesse you faire Dame: I am not to you known,\\nThough in your state of Honor I am perfect;\\nI doubt some danger do's approach you neerely.\\nIf you will take a homely mans aduice,\\nBe not found heere: Hence with your little ones\\nTo fright you thus.

Whether should I flye?\\nI haue done no harme. But I remember now\\nI am in this earthly world: where to do harme\\nIs often laudable, to do good sometime\\nAccounted dangerous folly. Why then (alas)\\nDo I put vp that womanly defence,\\nTo say I haue done no harme?\\nWhat are these faces?\\nEnter Murtherers.\\n\\n  Mur. Where is your Husband?\\n  Wife. I hope in no place so vnsanctified,\\nWhere such as thou may'st finde him\\n\\n   Mur. He's a Traitor\\n\\n   Son. Thou ly'st thou shagge-ear'd Villaine\\n\\n   Mur.

Let vs seeke out some desolate shade, & there\\nWeepe our sad bosomes empty\\n\\n   Macd. Let vs rather\\nHold fast the mortall Sword: and like good men,\\nBestride our downfall Birthdome: each new Morne,\\nNew Widdowes howle, new Orphans cry, new sorowes\\nStrike heauen on the face, that it resounds\\nAs if it felt with Scotland, and yell'd out\\nLike Syllable of Dolour\\n\\n   Mal. What I beleeue, Ile waile;\\nWhat know, beleeue; and what I can redresse,\\nAs I shall finde the time to friend: I wil.\\nWhat you haue spoke, it may be so perchance.\\nThis Tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,\\nWas once thought honest: you haue lou'd him well,\\nHe hath not touch'd you yet. I am yong, but something\\nYou may discerne of him through me, and wisedome\\nTo offer vp a weake, poore innocent Lambe\\nT' appease an angry God\\n\\n   Macd. I am not treacherous\\n\\n   Malc. But Macbeth is.\\nA good and vertuous Nature may recoyle\\nIn an Imperiall charge. But I shall craue your pardon:\\nThat which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose;\\nAngels are bright still, though the brightest fell.\\nThough all things foule, would wear the brows of grace\\nYet Grace must still looke so\\n\\n   Macd. I haue lost my Hopes\\n\\n   Malc. Perchance euen there\\nWhere I did finde my doubts.\\nWhy in that rawnesse left you Wife, and Childe?\\nThose precious Motiues, those strong knots of Loue,\\nWithout leaue-taking. I pray you,\\nLet not my Iealousies, be your Dishonors,\\nBut mine owne Safeties: you may be rightly iust,\\nWhat euer I shall thinke\\n\\n   Macd. Bleed, bleed poore Country,\\nGreat Tyrrany, lay thou thy basis sure,\\nFor goodnesse dare not check thee: wear y thy wrongs,\\nThe Title, is affear'd. Far thee well Lord,\\nI would not be the Villaine that thou think'st,\\nFor the whole Space that's in the Tyrants Graspe,\\nAnd the rich East to boot\\n\\n   Mal. Be not offended:\\nI speake not as in absolute feare of you:\\nI thinke our Country sinkes beneath the yoake,\\nIt weepes, it bleeds, and each new day a gash\\nIs added to her wounds. I thinke withall,\\nThere would be hands vplifted in my right:\\nAnd heere from gracious England haue I offer\\nOf goodly thousands. But for all this,\\nWhen I shall treade vpon the Tyrants head,\\nOr weare it on my Sword; yet my poore Country\\nShall haue more vices then it had before,\\nMore suffer, and more sundry wayes then euer,\\nBy him that shall succeede\\n\\n   Macd. What should he be?\\n  Mal. It is my selfe I meane: in whom I know\\nAll the particulars of Vice so grafted,\\nThat when they shall be open'd, blacke Macbeth\\nWill seeme as pure as Snow, and the poore State\\nEsteeme him as a Lambe, being compar'd\\nWith my confinelesse harmes\\n\\n   Macd. Not in the Legions\\nOf horrid Hell, can come a Diuell more damn'd\\nIn euils, to top Macbeth\\n\\n   Mal. I grant him Bloody,\\nLuxurious, Auaricious, False, Deceitfull,\\nSodaine, Malicious, smacking of euery sinne\\nThat ha's a name. But there's no bottome, none\\nIn my Voluptuousnesse: Your Wiues, your Daughters,\\nYour Matrons, and your Maides, could not fill vp\\nThe Cesterne of my Lust, and my Desire\\nAll continent Impediments would ore-beare\\nThat did oppose my will. Better Macbeth,\\nThen such an one to reigne\\n\\n   Macd. Boundlesse intemperance\\nIn Nature is a Tyranny: It hath beene\\nTh' vntimely emptying of the happy Throne,\\nAnd fall of many Kings. But feare not yet\\nTo take vpon you what is yours: you may\\nConuey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,\\nAnd yet seeme cold. The time you may so hoodwinke:\\nWe haue willing Dames enough: there cannot be\\nThat Vulture in you, to deuoure so many\\nAs will to Greatnesse dedicate themselues,\\nFinding it so inclinde\\n\\n   Mal. With this, there growes\\nIn my most ill-composd Affection, such\\nA stanchlesse Auarice, that were I King,\\nI should cut off the Nobles for their Lands,\\nDesire his Iewels, and this others House,\\nAnd my more-hauing, would be as a Sawce\\nTo make me hunger more, that I should forge\\nQuarrels vniust against the Good and Loyall,\\nDestroying them for wealth\\n\\n   Macd. This Auarice\\nstickes deeper: growes with more pernicious roote\\nThen Summer-seeming Lust: and it hath bin\\nThe Sword of our slaine Kings: yet do not feare,\\nScotland hath Foysons, to fill vp your will\\nOf your meere Owne. All these are portable,\\nWith other Graces weigh'd\\n\\n   Mal. But I haue none. The King-becoming Graces,\\nAs Iustice, Verity, Temp'rance, Stablenesse,\\nBounty, Perseuerance, Mercy, Lowlinesse,\\nDeuotion, Patience, Courage, Fortitude,\\nI haue no rellish of them, but abound\\nIn the diuision of each seuerall Crime,\\nActing it many wayes. Nay, had I powre, I should\\nPoure the sweet Milke of Concord, into Hell,\\nVprore the vniuersall peace, confound\\nAll vnity on earth\\n\\n   Macd. O Scotland, Scotland\\n\\n   Mal. If such a one be fit to gouerne, speake:\\nI am as I haue spoken\\n\\n   Mac. Fit to gouern? No not to liue. O Natio[n] miserable!\\nWith an vntitled Tyrant, bloody Sceptred,\\nWhen shalt thou see thy wholsome dayes againe?\\nSince that the truest Issue of thy Throne\\nBy his owne Interdiction stands accust,\\nAnd do's blaspheme his breed? Thy Royall Father\\nWas a most Sainted-King: the Queene that bore thee,\\nOftner vpon her knees, then on her feet,\\nDy'de euery day she liu'd. Fare thee well,\\nThese Euils thou repeat'st vpon thy selfe,\\nHath banish'd me from Scotland. O my Brest,\\nThy hope ends heere\\n\\n   Mal. Macduff, this Noble passion\\nChilde of integrity, hath from my soule\\nWip'd the blacke Scruples, reconcil'd my thoughts\\nTo thy good Truth, and Honor. Diuellish Macbeth,\\nBy many of these traines, hath sought to win me\\nInto his power: and modest Wisedome pluckes me\\nFrom ouer-credulous hast: but God aboue\\nDeale betweene thee and me; For euen now\\nI put my selfe to thy Direction, and\\nVnspeake mine owne detraction. Heere abiure\\nThe taints, and blames I laide vpon my selfe,\\nFor strangers to my Nature. I am yet\\nVnknowne to Woman, neuer was forsworne,\\nScarsely haue coueted what was mine owne.\\nAt no time broke my Faith, would not betray\\nThe Deuill to his Fellow, and delight\\nNo lesse in truth then life. My first false speaking\\nWas this vpon my selfe. What I am truly\\nIs thine, and my poore Countries to command:\\nWhither indeed, before they heere approach\\nOld Seyward with ten thousand warlike men\\nAlready at a point, was setting foorth:\\nNow wee'l together, and the chance of goodnesse\\nBe like our warranted Quarrell. Why are you silent?\\n  Macd. Such welcome, and vnwelcom things at once\\n'Tis hard to reconcile.\\nEnter a Doctor.\\n\\n  Mal. Well, more anon. Comes the King forth\\nI pray you?\\n  Doct.

With this strange vertue,\\nHe hath a heauenly guift of Prophesie,\\nAnd sundry Blessings hang about his Throne,\\nThat speake him full of Grace.\\nEnter Rosse.\\n\\n  Macd.

Good God betimes remoue\\nThe meanes that makes vs Strangers\\n\\n   Rosse. Sir, Amen\\n\\n   Macd. Stands Scotland where it did?\\n  Rosse. Alas poore Countrey,\\nAlmost affraid to know it selfe. It cannot\\nBe call'd our Mother, but our Graue; where nothing\\nBut who knowes nothing, is once seene to smile:\\nWhere sighes, and groanes, and shrieks that rent the ayre\\nAre made, not mark'd: Where violent sorrow seemes\\nA Moderne extasie: The Deadmans knell,\\nIs there scarse ask'd for who, and good mens liues\\nExpire before the Flowers in their Caps,\\nDying, or ere they sicken\\n\\n   Macd. Oh Relation; too nice, and yet too true\\n\\n   Malc. What's the newest griefe?\\n  Rosse. That of an houres age, doth hisse the speaker,\\nEach minute teemes a new one\\n\\n   Macd.

No, they were wel at peace, when I did leaue 'em\\n  Macd. Be not a niggard of your speech: How gos't?\\n  Rosse. When I came hither to transport the Tydings\\nWhich I haue heauily borne, there ran a Rumour\\nOf many worthy Fellowes, that were out,\\nWhich was to my beleefe witnest the rather,\\nFor that I saw the Tyrants Power a-foot.\\nNow is the time of helpe: your eye in Scotland\\nWould create Soldiours, make our women fight,\\nTo doffe their dire distresses\\n\\n   Malc. Bee't their comfort\\nWe are comming thither: Gracious England hath\\nLent vs good Seyward, and ten thousand men,\\nAn older, and a better Souldier, none\\nThat Christendome giues out\\n\\n   Rosse. Would I could answer\\nThis comfort with the like. But I haue words\\nThat would be howl'd out in the desert ayre,\\nWhere hearing should not latch them\\n\\n   Macd.

No minde that's honest\\nBut in it shares some woe, though the maine part\\nPertaines to you alone\\n\\n   Macd. If it be mine\\nKeepe it not from me, quickly let me haue it\\n\\n   Rosse. Let not your eares dispise my tongue for euer,\\nWhich shall possesse them with the heauiest sound\\nthat euer yet they heard\\n\\n   Macd. Humh: I guesse at it\\n\\n   Rosse. Your Castle is surpriz'd: your Wife, and Babes\\nSauagely slaughter'd: To relate the manner\\nWere on the Quarry of these murther'd Deere\\nTo adde the death of you\\n\\n   Malc. Mercifull Heauen:\\nWhat man, ne're pull your hat vpon your browes:\\nGiue sorrow words; the griefe that do's not speake,\\nWhispers the o're-fraught heart, and bids it breake\\n\\n   Macd.

    "Now that we've worked through generating some baseline corpus statistics for one corpus, it's up to you to select a second corpus and generate your own corpus statistics, and then compare and contrast the two. For simplicity's sake, we recommend you stick to a corpus from `nltk.corpus.gutenberg`--although comparing the diction found in a classic work of fiction to something like a presidential State of the Union address could be interesting, it's not really an apples-to-apples comparison, and those corpora could also require additional preprocessing steps that are outside the scope of this lab. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the cells below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select another corpus from `gutenberg.fileids()`.  \n",
    "<br>  \n",
    "2. Clean, preprocess, tokenize, and generate corpus statistics for this new corpus.   \n",
    "<br>   \n",
    "3. Perform a comparative analysis using the Macbeth statistics we generated above and your new corpus statistics. How are they similar? How are they different? Was there anything interesting or surprising that you found in your comparison? Create at least 1 meaningful visualization comparing the two corpora."
